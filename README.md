# Python Assignment

## Overview
Welcome to our Python Assignment project! This project is designed to [briefly describe the purpose or goal of the project].

## Technology Stack
- **FastAPI**: A modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+.
- **Celery**: An asynchronous task queue based on distributed message passing.
- **Redis**: A message broker used with Celery for task queue management.
- **Python**: The core programming language used for development.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
git clone git@github.com:amanbondekar/Python-Assignment.git


2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
cd Python-Assignment



3. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
pip install -r requirements.txt


5. **Start the Celery Worker** (if applicable):
```bash
celery -A celery_worker worker --loglevel=info
Run the FastAPI Application:


uvicorn main:app --reload
Access the application at http://localhost:8000.
