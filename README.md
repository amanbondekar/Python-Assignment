# Python-Assignment
Introduction
Welcome to our project! This project aims to provide a solution for [brief description of what the project is meant for]. It is designed to [mention the main objectives or goals of the project].

Tech Stack
The project is built using the following technologies:

FastAPI: FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
Celery: Celery is an asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing.
Redis: Redis is used as a message broker for Celery to manage the task queue.
Python: The core programming language used for development.
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Clone the Repository:

git clone (https://github.com/amanbondekar/Python-Assignment/)
Navigate to the Project Directory:


cd Python-Assignment
Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up Celery Worker:
If you're using Celery, start the Celery worker in a separate terminal window:

celery -A celery_worker worker --loglevel=info
Run the FastAPI Application:

uvicorn main:app --reload
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8000.

Development Conventions and Details
